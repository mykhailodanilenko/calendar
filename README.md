# Meeting room calendar
## This is a meeting room calendar capable of:
- creating an event in a weekly calendar view
- viewing all events in the calendar
- filtering events by user
- deleting events from the calendar
- keeping the events in place after page refresh
- restricting double events in a single slot

To create an event simply click "New event+". If there is anything else you would like to get assistance with, please send me a DM on telegram at @mishadanilenko.
